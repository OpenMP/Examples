\chapter{Restrictions on the \code{atomic} Construct}
\label{chap:atomic_restrict}

The following non-conforming examples illustrate the restrictions on the \code{atomic} 
construct. 

\cexample{atomic_restrict}{1c}

\fexample{atomic_restrict}{1f}

\cexample{atomic_restrict}{2c}

\fortranspecificstart
The following example is non-conforming because \code{I} and \code{R} reference 
the same location but have different types.

\fnexample{atomic_restrict}{2f}

Although the following example might work on some implementations, this is also 
non-conforming:

\fnexample{atomic_restrict}{3f}
