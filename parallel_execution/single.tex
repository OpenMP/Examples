\index{single construct@\kcode{single} construct}

The following example demonstrates the \kcode{single} construct. In the example, 
only one thread prints each of the progress messages. All other threads will skip 
the \kcode{single} region and stop at the barrier at the end of the \kcode{single} 
construct until all threads in the team have reached the barrier. If other threads 
can proceed without waiting for the thread executing the \kcode{single} region, 
a \kcode{nowait} clause can be specified, as is done in the third \kcode{single} 
construct in this example. The user must not make any assumptions as to which thread 
will execute a \kcode{single} region.
