\chapter{The \code{parallel} Construct}
\label{chap:parallel}

The \code{parallel} construct  can be used in coarse-grain parallel programs. 
In the following example, each thread in the \code{parallel} region decides what 
part of the global array \plc{x} to work on, based on the thread number:

\cexample{parallel}{1c}

\fexample{parallel}{1f}
