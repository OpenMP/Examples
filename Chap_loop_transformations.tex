\cchapter{Loop Transformations}{loop_transformations}
\label{chap:loop_transformations}

To obtain better performance on a platform, code may need to be restructured 
relative to the way it is written (which is often for best readability).
User-directed loop transformations accomplish this goal by providing a means 
to separate code semantics and its optimization.

A loop transformation construct states that a transformation operation is to be 
performed on set of nested loops.  This directive approach can target specific loops
for transformation, rather than applying more time-consuming general compiler 
heuristics methods with compiler options that may not be able to discover 
optimal transformations.

Loop transformations can be augmented by preprocessor support or OpenMP \code{metadirective} 
directives, to select optimal dimension and size parameters for specific platforms,
facilitating a single code base for multiple platforms.
Moreover, directive-based transformations make experimenting easier: 
whereby specific hot spots can be affected by transformation directives.
