The source codes for examples in each chapter are in the sources directory
under the corresponding chapter directory:

../SIMD/sources
../affinity/sources
../data_environment/sources
../devices/sources
../loop_transformations/sources
../memory_model/sources
../parallel_execution/sources
../program_control/sources
../synchronization/sources
../tasking/sources

This directory contains the test_codes script that performs
a quick compilation test of all example codes (default).  The
test results are stored in the test_codes.log file.  The script 
tries to automatically detect a compiler. Set the comp_c, comp_cc 
and comp_f variables if that doesn't work.  

          The test script (test_codes) is 

    ***** for reference purpose only and is NOT intended to validate *****

          OpenMP compliance of a compiler.

July 31 2021 Changes
* Automatic compiler determination (no need to specify comp_c, etc.)
* Automatic version (DATE/NUMBER) determination
* Automatic Backdown (replacement) for deprecation if compiler is not 5.1/5.0
  (replacements: masked->master,primary->master, *lock_hint*->*lock_sync*)
* Automatic -c compiler flag for "linkable=no" metadata
* Utilities file, test_utils, created for clean coding
* Command line now takes file name argument (just file name, not path)
* sourceme file: puts test_codes in PATH, creates tc alias, defines OMP_BASE_DI
