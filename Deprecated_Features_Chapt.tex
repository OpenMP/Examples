\bchapter{Deprecated Features}
\label{chap:deprecated_features}

Deprecation of features began in OpenMP 5.0. 
Examples that use a deprecated feature have been updated with an equivalent replacement feature.  

Deprecations affecting examples are the following:
\begin{description}[labelindent=5mm,font=\normalfont]
\item[5.1] -- \ \scode{masked} construct          replaces \scode{master} construct.
\item[5.1] -- \ \scode{primary} affinity policy   replaces \scode{master} affinity policy.
\item[5.0] -- \ \scode{omp_sync_hint_*} constants replace  \scode{omp_lock_hint_*} constants.
\end{description}

These replacements appear in examples that illustrate, otherwise, earlier features.
When using a compiler that is compliant with a version prior to 
the indicated version, the earlier form of
an example is restored by a C-style conditional compilation using the \scode{_OPENMP} macro.

Since Fortran compilers do not preprocess codes by default, a Fortran preprocessor
flag will be required to compile Fortran examples with the C-style conditional 
compilation statements.
