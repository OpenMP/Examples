\chapter{The \code{reduction} Clause}
\label{chap:reduction}

The following example demonstrates the \code{reduction} clause ; note that some 
reductions can be expressed in the loop in several ways, as shown for the \code{max} 
and \code{min} reductions below:

\cexample{reduction}{1c}

\fexample{reduction}{1f}

A common implementation of the preceding example is to treat it as if it had been 
written as follows:

\cexample{reduction}{2c}

\fortranspecificstart
\fnexample{reduction}{2f}

The following program is non-conforming because the reduction is on the 
\emph{intrinsic procedure name} \code{MAX} but that name has been redefined to be the variable 
named \code{MAX}.

\fnexample{reduction}{3f}

The following conforming program performs the reduction using the 
\emph{intrinsic procedure name} \code{MAX} even though the intrinsic \code{MAX} has been renamed 
to \code{REN}.

\fnexample{reduction}{4f}

The following conforming program performs the reduction using 
\plc{intrinsic procedure name} \code{MAX} even though the intrinsic \code{MAX} has been renamed 
to \code{MIN}.

\fnexample{reduction}{5f}
\fortranspecificend

The following example is non-conforming because the initialization (\code{a = 
0}) of the original list item \code{a} is not synchronized with the update of 
\code{a} as a result of the reduction computation in the \code{for} loop. Therefore, 
the example may print an incorrect value for \code{a}.

To avoid this problem, the initialization of the original list item \code{a} 
should complete before any update of \code{a} as a result of the \code{reduction} 
clause. This can be achieved by adding an explicit barrier after the assignment 
\code{a = 0}, or by enclosing the assignment \code{a = 0} in a \code{single} 
directive (which has an implied barrier), or by initializing \code{a} before 
the start of the \code{parallel} region.
