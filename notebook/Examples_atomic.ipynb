Otherwise, some other thread might  read or write part of the variable while the current thread was reading or writing  another part of the variable. Note that most hardware provides atomic reads and  writes for some set of properly aligned variables of specific sizes, but not necessarily  for all the variable types supported by the OpenMP API."
