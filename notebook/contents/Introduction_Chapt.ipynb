The directives extend the C, C++ and Fortran base languages with single program multiple data (SPMD) constructs, tasking constructs, device constructs, worksharing constructs, and synchronization constructs, and they provide support for sharing and privatizing data. The functionality to control the runtime environment is provided by library routines and environment variables. Compilers that support the OpenMP API often include a command line option to the compiler that activates and allows interpretation of all OpenMP directives."
