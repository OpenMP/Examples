    " OpenMP Affinity consists of a  `proc_bind`  policy (thread affinity policy) and a specification of places ( ' location units '  or  _processors_  that may be cores, hardware threads, sockets, etc.).   OpenMP Affinity enables users to bind computations on specific places. The placement will hold for the duration of the parallel region.  However, the runtime is free to migrate the OpenMP threads  to different cores (hardware threads, sockets, etc.) prescribed within a given place,  if two or more cores (hardware threads, sockets, etc.) have been assigned to a given place."

    " Often the binding can be managed without resorting to explicitly setting places. Without the specification of places in the  `OMP_PLACES`  variable,  the OpenMP runtime will distribute and bind threads using the entire range of processors for  the OpenMP program, according to the  `OMP_PROC_BIND`  environment variable or the  `proc_bind`  clause.  When places are specified, the OMP runtime binds threads to the places according to a default distribution policy, or those specified in the  `OMP_PROC_BIND`  environment variable or the  `proc_bind`  clause."

    " In the OpenMP Specifications document a processor refers to an execution unit that is enabled for an OpenMP thread to use.  A processor is a core when there is no SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) support or SMT is disabled.  When  SMT is enabled, a processor is a hardware thread (HW-thread). (This is the usual case; but actually, the execution unit is implementation defined.) Processor numbers are numbered sequentially from 0 to the number of cores less one (without SMT), or 0 to the number HW-threads less one (with SMT). OpenMP places use the processor number to designate binding locations (unless an  ' abstract name '  is used.) "
