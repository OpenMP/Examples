    "A loop transformation construct states that a transformation operation is to be  performed on set of nested loops.  This directive approach can target specific loops for transformation, rather than applying more time-consuming general compiler  heuristics methods with compiler options that may not be able to discover  optimal transformations."

Moreover, directive-based transformations make experimenting easier:  whereby specific hot spots can be affected by transformation directives."
