Multiple critical regions may exist in a parallel region, and may act cooperatively (only one thread at a time in all `critical` regions), or separately (only one thread at a time in each `critical` regions when a unique name is supplied on each `critical` construct). An optional (lock) `hint` clause may be specified on a named `critical`  construct to provide the OpenMP runtime guidance in selection a locking  mechanism."

    "On a finer scale the `atomic` construct allows only a single thread at  a time to have atomic access to a storage location involving a single read,  write, update or capture statement, and a limited number of combinations  when specifying the `capture`  _atomic-clause_  clause.  The  _atomic-clause_  clause is required for some expression statements, but is not required for `update` statements. The  _memory-order_  clause can be used to specify the degree of memory ordering enforced by an `atomic` construct. From weakest to strongest, they are `relaxed` (the default), acquire and/or release clauses (specified with `acquire`, `release`, or `acq_rel`), and `seq_cst`.  Please see the details in the  _atomic Construct_  subsection of the  _Directives_  chapter in the OpenMP Specifications document."

    "The `flush` directive is a stand-alone construct for enforcing consistency between a thread's view of memory and the view of memory for other threads (see the Memory Model chapter of this document for more details). When the construct is used with an explicit variable list, a  _strong flush_  that forces a thread's temporary view of memory to be consistent with the actual memory is applied to all listed variables. When the construct is used without an explicit variable list and without a  _memory-order_  clause, a strong flush is applied to all locally thread-visible data as defined by the base language, and additionally the construct provides both acquire and release memory ordering semantics.  When an explicit variable list is not present and a  _memory-order_  clause is present, the construct provides acquire and/or release memory ordering semantics according to the  _memory-order_  clause, but no strong flush is performed. A resulting strong flush that applies to a set of variables effectively ensures that no memory (load or store) operation for the affected variables may be reordered across the `flush` directive."

    "General-purpose routines provide mutual exclusion semantics through locks,  represented by lock variables.   The semantics allows a task to  _set_ , and hence   _own_  a lock, until it is  _unset_  by the task that set it. A   _nestable_  lock can be set multiple times by a task, and is used when in code requires nested control of locks.  A  _simple lock_  can only be set once by the owning task. There are specific calls for the two types of locks, and the variable of a specific lock type cannot be used by the other lock type."

    "Any explicit task will observe the synchronization prescribed in a  `barrier` construct and an implied barrier.  Also, additional synchronizations  are available for tasks.  All children of a task will wait at a `taskwait` (for  their siblings to complete).  A `taskgroup` construct creates a region in which the current task is suspended at the end of the region until all sibling tasks,  and their descendants, have completed.  Scheduling constraints on task execution can be prescribed by the `depend` clause to enforce dependence on previously generated tasks. More details on controlling task executions can be found in the  _Tasking_  Chapter in the OpenMP Specifications document."
