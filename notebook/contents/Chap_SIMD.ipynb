    "Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) is a form of parallel execution  in which the same operation is performed on multiple data elements  independently in hardware vector processing units (VPU), also called SIMD units. The addition of two vectors to form a third vector is a SIMD operation. Many processors have SIMD (vector) units that can perform simultaneously  2, 4, 8 or more executions of the same operation (by a single SIMD unit)."

    "Loops without loop-carried backward dependency (or with dependency preserved using  ordered simd) are candidates for vectorization by the compiler for  execution with SIMD units. In addition, with state-of-the-art vectorization  technology and `declare simd` directive extensions for function vectorization in the OpenMP 4.5 specification, loops with function calls can be vectorized as well.  The basic idea is that a scalar function call in a loop can be replaced by a vector version  of the function, and the loop can be vectorized simultaneously by combining a loop  vectorization (`simd` directive on the loop) and a function  vectorization (`declare simd` directive on the function)."
