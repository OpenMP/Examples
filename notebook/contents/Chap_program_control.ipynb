    " Some specific and elementary concepts of controlling program execution are illustrated in the examples of this chapter.  Control can be directly managed with conditional control  (ifdef's with the  `_OPENMP`   macro, and the Fortran sentinel ( `!$` )  for conditionally compiling). The  `if`  clause on some constructs can direct the runtime to ignore or alter the behavior of the construct. Of course, the base-language  `if`  statements can be used to control the 'execution'  of stand-alone directives (such as  `flush` ,  `barrier` ,  `taskwait` ,  and   `taskyield` ). However, the directives must appear in a block structure, and not as a substatement as shown in examples 1 and 2 of this chapter."

    " Cancellation (termination) of the normal sequence of execution for the threads in an OpenMP region can be  accomplished with the  `cancel`  construct.  The construct uses a  _construct-type-clause_  to set the region-type to activate for the cancellation.  That is, inclusion  of one of the  _construct-type-clause_  names  `parallel` ,  `for` ,   `do` ,  `sections`  or  `taskgroup`  on the directive line  activates the corresponding region.   The  `cancel`  construct is activated by the first encountering thread,  and it continues execution at the end of the named region. The  `cancel`  construct is also a cancellation point for any other thread of the team  to also continue execution at the end of the named region.  "
