    "Conditional compilation can be performed with conventional #ifdef directives in C, C++, and Fortran, and additionally with OpenMP sentinel (`!$`) in Fortran.  The `if` clause on some directives can direct the runtime to ignore or alter the behavior of the construct. Of course, the base-language `if` statements can be used to control the execution of stand-alone directives (such as `flush`, `barrier`, `taskwait`,  and  `taskyield`). However, the directives must appear in a block structure, and not as a substatement. The `metadirective` and `declare` `variant` directives provide conditional  selection of directives and routines for compilation (and use), respectively. The `assume` and `requires` directives provide invariants for optimizing compilation, and essential features for compilation  and correct execution, respectively."
