    " The following example shows how the  `cancel`  directive can be used to terminate  an OpenMP region. Although the  `cancel`  construct terminates the OpenMP  worksharing region, programmers must still track the exception through the pointer  ex and issue a cancellation for the  `parallel`  region if an exception has  been raised. The master thread checks the exception pointer to make sure that the  exception is properly handled in the sequential part. If cancellation of the  `parallel`   region has been requested, some threads might have executed  `phase_1()` .  However, it is guaranteed that none of the threads executed  `phase_2()` ."

The  creates a task to descend  into the child nodes of the current tree node.
