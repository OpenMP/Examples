    " In an OpenMP 5.0 compliant implementation, setting the   `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD`  variable to  `MANDATORY`  will  force the program to terminate execution when a  `target`   construct is encountered and the target device is not supported or is not available. With a value  `DEFAULT`  the target region will execute on a device if the  device exists and is supported by the implementation, otherwise it will execute on the host. Support for the  `DISABLED`  value is optional; when it is supported the behavior is as if only the  host device exists (other devices are considered non-existent to the runtime),  and target regions are executed on the host.
