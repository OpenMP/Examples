    " An  `ordered`  clause can be used on a loop construct with an integer parameter argument to define the number of associated loops within  a  _doacross loop nest_  where cross-iteration dependences exist. A  `depend`  clause on an  `ordered`  construct within an ordered  loop describes the dependences of the  _doacross_  loops. "

The  `depend(source)`  clause indicates  the completion of computation from the current iteration ( _i_ )  to satisfy the cross-iteration dependence that arises from the iteration. For this example the same sequential ordering could have been achieved  with an  `ordered`  clause without a parameter, on the loop directive,  and a single  `ordered`  directive without the  `depend`  clause specified for the statement executing the  _bar_  function."

In the C/C++ , the  _i_  and  _j_  loops are the first and second associated loops, respectively, whereas in the Fortran , the  _j_  and  _i_  loops are the first and second associated loops, respectively.

Likewise, the  `depend(sink:j-1,i)`  and  `depend(sink:j,i-1)`  clauses  in the Fortran  define cross-iteration dependences from iterations  ( _j-1, i_ ) and ( _j, i-1_ ) to iteration ( _j, i_ )."
