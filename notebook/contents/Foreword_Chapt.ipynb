Draft examples are often derived from case studies for new features in the language, and are revised to illustrate the basic application of the features with code comments, and a text description. We are grateful to the numerous members of the Language Committee  who took the time to prepare codes and descriptions, and shepherd them through the acceptance process. We sincerely appreciate the Example Subcommittee members, who  actively participated and contributed in weekly meetings over the years."
