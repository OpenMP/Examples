In this first example, the  `task`  construct has  been annotated with the  `mergeable`   clause. The addition of this clause  allows the implementation to reuse the data environment (including the ICVs) of  the parent task for the task inside  `foo`  if the task is included or undeferred.  Thus, the result of the execution may differ depending on whether the task is merged  or not. Therefore the mergeable clause needs to be used with caution. In this example,  the use of the mergeable clause is safe. As  `x`  is a shared variable the  outcome does not depend on whether or not the task is merged (that is, the task  will always increment the same variable and will always compute the same value  for  `x` )."
