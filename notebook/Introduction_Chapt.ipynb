" \n",
"    1. To change formatting, appearance, or style, please edit openmp.sty. \n",
" \n",
"    2. Custom commands and macros are defined in openmp.sty. \n",
" \n",
"    3. Be kind to other editors -- keep a consistent style by copying-and-pasting to \n",
"       create new content. \n",
" \n",
"    4. We use semantic markup, e.g. (see openmp.sty for a full list): \n",
"          ``      \n",
" for bold monospace keywords, code, operators, etc. \n",
"          __       \n",
" for italic placeholder names, grammar, etc. \n",
" \n",
"    5. Other recommendations: \n",
"         Use the convenience macros defined in openmp.sty for the minor headers \n",
"         such as Comments, Syntax, etc. \n",
" \n",
"         To keep items together on the same page, prefer the use of  \n",
"         .... Avoid parbox for text blocks as it interrupts line numbering. \n",
"         When possible, avoid filbreak, , newpage, clearpage unless that's \n",
"         what you mean. Use needspace{} cautiously for troublesome paragraphs. \n",
" \n",
"         Avoid absolute lengths and measures in this file; use relative units when possible. \n",
"         Vertical space can be relative to baselineskip or ex units. Horizontal space \n",
"         can be relative to linewidth or em units. \n",
" \n",
"         Prefer emph{} to italicize terminology, e.g.: \n",
"             This is a emph{definition}, not a placeholder. \n",
"             This is a  _var-name_ . \n",

  " The directives, library routines, and environment variables demonstrated in this document allow users to create and manage parallel programs while permitting portability. The directives extend the C, C++ and Fortran base languages with single program multiple data (SPMD) constructs, tasking constructs, device constructs, worksharing constructs, and synchronization constructs, and they provide support for sharing and privatizing data. The functionality to control the runtime environment is provided by library routines and environment variables. Compilers that support the OpenMP API often include a command line option to the compiler that activates and allows interpretation of all OpenMP directives."
