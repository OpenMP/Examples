  " According to Section 2.3 of the OpenMP 4.0 specification, an OpenMP implementation must act as if there are ICVs that control  the behavior of the program.  This example illustrates two ICVs,  _nthreads-var_   and  _max-active-levels-var_ . The  _nthreads-var_  ICV controls the  number of threads requested for encountered parallel regions; there is one copy  of this ICV per task. The  _max-active-levels-var_  ICV controls the maximum  number of nested active parallel regions; there is one copy of this ICV for the  whole program."

  " In the following example, the  _nest-var_ ,  _max-active-levels-var_ ,   _dyn-var_ , and  _nthreads-var_  ICVs are modified through calls to  the runtime library routines  `omp_set_nested` ,  `omp_set_max_active_levels` , `  omp_set_dynamic` , and  `omp_set_num_threads`  respectively. These ICVs  affect the operation of  `parallel`  regions. Each implicit task generated  by a  `parallel`  region has its own copy of the  _nest-var, dyn-var_ ,  and  _nthreads-var_  ICVs."
