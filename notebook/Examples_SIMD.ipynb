   " When a function can be inlined within a loop the compiler has an opportunity to  vectorize the loop. By guaranteeing SIMD behavior of a function's operations,  characterizing the arguments of the function and privatizing temporary  variables of the loop, the compiler can often create faster, vector code for  the loop. In the examples below the  `declare`   `simd`  construct is  used on the  _add1_  and  _add2_  functions to enable creation of their  corresponding SIMD function versions for execution within the associated SIMD  loop. The functions characterize two different approaches of accessing data  within the function: by a single variable and as an element in a data array,  respectively. The  _add3_  C function uses dereferencing. "

   " The  `declare`   `simd`  constructs also illustrate the use of   `uniform`  and  `linear`  clauses.  The  `uniform(fact)`  clause  indicates that the variable  _fact_  is invariant across the SIMD lanes. In  the  _add2_  function  _a_  and  _b_  are included in the  `unform`   list because the C pointer and the Fortran array references are constant.  The   _i_  index used in the  _add2_  function is included in a  `linear`   clause with a constant-linear-step of 1, to guarantee a unity increment of the  associated loop. In the  `declare`   `simd`  construct for the  _add3_   C function the   `linear(a,b:1)`  clause instructs the compiler to generate  unit-stride loads across the SIMD lanes; otherwise,  costly emph{gather}  instructions would be generated for the unknown sequence of access of the  pointer dereferences.
