   " An  `ordered`  clause can be used on a loop construct with an integer parameter argument to define the number of associated loops within  a  _doacross loop nest_  where cross-iteration dependences exist. A  `depend`  clause on an  `ordered`  construct within an ordered  loop describes the dependences of the  _doacross_  loops.  "

   " In the code below, the  `depend(sink:i-1)`  clause defines an  _i-1_   to  _i_  cross-iteration dependence that specifies a wait point for  the completion of computation from iteration  _i-1_  before proceeding  to the subsequent statements. The  `depend(source)`  clause indicates  the completion of computation from the current iteration ( _i_ )  to satisfy the cross-iteration dependence that arises from the iteration. For this example the same sequential ordering could have been achieved  with an  `ordered`  clause without a parameter, on the loop directive,  and a single  `ordered`  directive without the  `depend`  clause specified for the statement executing the  _bar_  function.

   " The following code is similar to the previous example but with   _doacross loop nest_  extended to two nested loops,  _i_  and  _j_ ,  as specified by the  `ordered(2)`  clause on the loop directive.  In the C/C++ code, the  _i_  and  _j_  loops are the first and second associated loops, respectively, whereas in the Fortran code, the  _j_  and  _i_  loops are the first and second associated loops, respectively. The  `depend(sink:i-1,j)`  and  `depend(sink:i,j-1)`  clauses in  the C/C++ code define cross-iteration dependences in two dimensions from  iterations ( _i-1, j_ ) and ( _i, j-1_ ) to iteration ( _i, j_ ).   Likewise, the  `depend(sink:j-1,i)`  and  `depend(sink:j,i-1)`  clauses  in the Fortran code define cross-iteration dependences from iterations  ( _j-1, i_ ) and ( _j, i-1_ ) to iteration ( _j, i_ ).

   " The following example shows the incorrect use of the  `ordered`   directive with a  `depend`  clause.  There are two issues with the code.   The first issue is a missing  `ordered` ~ `depend(source)`  directive, which could cause a deadlock.   The second issue is the  `depend(sink:i+1,j)`  and  `depend(sink:i,j+1)`   clauses define dependences on lexicographically later  source iterations ( _i+1, j_ ) and ( _i, j+1_ ), which could cause  a deadlock as well since they may not start to execute until the current iteration completes.
