    " In this chapter, examples illustrate race conditions on access to variables with shared data-sharing attributes.  A race condition can exist when two or more threads are involved in accessing a variable in which not all of the accesses are reads; that is, a WaR, RaW or WaW condition exists (R=read, a=after, W=write). A RaR does not produce a race condition.  Ensuring thread execution order at the processor level is not enough to avoid race conditions, because the local storage at the processor level (registers, caches, etc.) must be synchronized so that a consistent view of the variable in the memory hierarchy can be seen by the threads accessing the variable."

    " OpenMP provides a shared-memory model which allows all threads access to  _memory_  (shared data).  Each thread also has exclusive access to  _threadprivate memory_  (private data).  A private variable referenced in an OpenMP directive's structured block is a new version of the original variable (with the same name) for each task (or SIMD lane) within the code block.  A private variable is initially undefined (except for variables in  `firstprivate`  and  `linear`  clauses), and the original variable value is unaltered by assignments to the private variable, (except for  `reduction` ,  `lastprivate`  and  `linear`  clauses)."
