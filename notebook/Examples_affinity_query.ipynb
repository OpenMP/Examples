For example, in a 2 socket system with 8 cores in each socket, and sequential numbering in the socket for the core numbers, the  `OMP_PLACES`  variable would be set to '{0:8},{8:8}', using the place syntax { _lower_bound_ : _length_ : _stride_ }, and the default stride of 1.

    " The outer parallel region forms a team of threads, and each thread  executes on a socket (place) because the  `proc_bind`  clause uses   `spread`  in the outer  `parallel`  construct. Next, in the  _socket_init_  function, an inner parallel region creates a team  of threads equal to the number of elements (core numbers) from the place of the parent thread. Because the outer  `parallel`  construct uses  a  `spread`  affinity policy, each of its threads inherits a subpartition of  the original partition.  Hence, the  `omp_get_place_num_procs`  query function returns the number of elements (here procs = cores) in the subpartition of the thread.   After each parent thread creates its nested parallel region on the section, the socket number and thread number are reported. "

For instance, the socket number and proc_id's for a socket  can be found in the /proc/cpuinfo text file on Linux systems. "
