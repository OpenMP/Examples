  " Initially, one task (the task executing the  `start_background_work()`   call) is created in the  `parallel`  region, and later a parallel tree traversal  is started (the task executing the root of the recursive  `compute_tree()`   calls). While synchronizing tasks at the end of each tree traversal, using the   `taskgroup`  construct ensures that the formerly started background task  does not participate in the synchronization, and is left free to execute in parallel.  This is opposed to the behaviour of the  `taskwait`  construct, which would  include the background tasks in the synchronization."
