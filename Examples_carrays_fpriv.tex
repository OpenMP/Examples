\chapter{C/C++ Arrays in a \code{firstprivate} Clause}

\label{chap:carrays_fpriv}

The following example illustrates the size and value of list items of array or 
pointer type in a \code{firstprivate} clause . The size of new list items is 
based on the type of the corresponding original list item, as determined by the 
base language.

In this example:

\begin{compactitem}
\item The type of \code{A} is array of two arrays of two ints.

\item  The type of \code{B} is adjusted to pointer to array of \code{n} 
ints, because it is a function parameter.

\item  The type of \code{C} is adjusted to pointer to int, because 
it is a function parameter.

\item  The type of \code{D} is array of two arrays of two ints.

\item  The type of \code{E} is array of \code{n} arrays of \code{n} 
ints.
\end{compactitem}

Note that  \code{B} and \code{E} involve variable length array types.

The new items of array type are initialized as if each integer element of the original 
array is assigned to the corresponding element of the new array. Those of pointer 
type are initialized as if by assignment from the original item to the new item.
