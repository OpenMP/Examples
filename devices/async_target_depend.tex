\section{Asynchronous \kcode{target} Execution and Dependences}
\label{sec:async_target_exec_depend}

Asynchronous execution of a \kcode{target} region can be accomplished
by creating an explicit task around the \kcode{target} region. Examples
with explicit tasks are shown at the beginning of this section. 

As of OpenMP 4.5 and beyond the \kcode{nowait} clause can be used on the
\kcode{target} directive for asynchronous execution. Examples with 
\kcode{nowait} clauses follow the examples with explicit tasks.

This section also shows the use of \kcode{depend} clauses to order 
executions through dependences.
