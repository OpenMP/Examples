\section{The \code{loop} Construct}
\label{sec:loop}

The following example illustrates the use of the OpenMP 5.0 \code{loop}
construct for the execution of a loop.
The \code{loop} construct asserts to the compiler that the iterations 
of the loop are free of data dependencies and may be executed concurrently.
It allows the compiler to use heuristics to select the parallelization scheme
and compiler-level optimizations for the concurrency.
