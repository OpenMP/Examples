\begin{ccppspecific}
The following example illustrates the use of conditional compilation using the 
OpenMP macro \kcode{_OPENMP}. With OpenMP compilation, the \kcode{_OPENMP} 
macro becomes defined.

\begin{fortranspecific}
The following example illustrates the use of the conditional compilation sentinel. 
With OpenMP compilation, the conditional compilation sentinel \scode{!$} is recognized 
and treated as two spaces. In fixed form source, statements guarded by the sentinel 
must start after column 6.
