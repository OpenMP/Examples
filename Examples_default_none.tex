\chapter{The \code{default(none)} Clause}
\label{chap:default_none}

The following example distinguishes the variables that are affected by the \code{default(none)} 
clause from those that are not. 
Beginning with OpenMP 4.0, variables with \code{const}-qualified type and no mutable member 
are no longer predetermined shared.  Thus, these variables (variable \plc{c} in the example) 
need to be explicitly listed
in data-sharing attribute clauses when the \code{default(none)} clause is specified.

\cexample{default_none}{1c}

\fexample{default_none}{1f}
