\chapter{The \code{taskloop} Construct}
\label{chap:taskloop}

The following example illustrates how to execute a long running task concurrently with tasks created
with a \code{task loop} directive for a loop having unbalanced amounts of work for its iterations.

The \code{grainsize} clause specifies that each task is to execute at least 500 iterations of the loop. 

The \code{nogroup} clause removes the implicit taskgroup of the \code{taskloop} construct; the explicit \code{taskgroup} construct in the example ensures that the function is not exited before the long-running task and the loops have finished execution.
