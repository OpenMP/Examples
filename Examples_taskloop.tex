\chapter{The \code{taskloop} Construct}
\label{chap:taskloop}

The following example illustrates how to use the \code{taskloop} construct to overlap a long running tasks and an imbalanced loop.
The function \code{long\_running\_running} will be executed in an OpenMP task, while the \code{taskloop} generates OpenMP tasks for the \code{for} and \code{do} loops.
The \code{grainsize} clause specifies that each chunk has at least 500, but no more than 1,000, logical loop iterations.
The \code{nogroup} clause removes the implicit taskgroup of the \code{taskloop} construct; the explicit \code{taskgroup} construct in the example ensures that the function is not exited, before both the long-running task and the loops have finished execution.
