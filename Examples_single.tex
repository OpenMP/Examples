\chapter{The \code{single} Construct}
\label{chap:single}

The following example demonstrates the \code{single} construct. In the example, 
only one thread prints each of the progress messages. All other threads will skip 
the \code{single} region and stop at the barrier at the end of the \code{single} 
construct until all threads in the team have reached the barrier. If other threads 
can proceed without waiting for the thread executing the \code{single} region, 
a \code{nowait} clause can be specified, as is done in the third \code{single} 
construct in this example. The user must not make any assumptions as to which thread 
will execute a \code{single} region.
