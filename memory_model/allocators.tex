OpenMP memory allocators can be used to allocate memory with
specific allocator traits.  In the following example an OpenMP allocator is used to
specify an alignment for arrays \plc{x} and \plc{y}. The
general approach for attributing traits to variables allocated by
OpenMP is to create or specify a pre-defined \plc{memory space}, create an
array of \plc{traits}, and then form an \plc{allocator} from the
memory space and trait.
The allocator is then specified
in an OpenMP allocation (using an API \plc{omp\_alloc()} function
for C/C++ code and an \code{allocators} directive for Fortran code
in the \splc{allocators.1} example).

In the example below the \plc{xy\_memspace} variable is declared
and assigned the default memory space (\plc{omp\_default\_mem\_space}).
Next, an array for \plc{traits} is created. Since only one
trait will be used, the array size is \plc{1}.
A trait is a structure in C/C++ and a derived type in Fortran,
containing 2 components: a key and a corresponding value (key-value pair).
The trait key used here is \plc{omp\_atk\_alignment} (an enum for C/C++
and a parameter for Fortran)
and the trait value of 64 is specified in the \plc{xy\_traits} declaration.
These declarations are followed by a call to the
\plc{omp\_init\_allocator()} function to combine the memory
space (\plc{xy\_memspace}) and the traits (\plc{xy\_traits})
to form an allocator (\plc{xy\_alloc}).

%In the C/C++ code the API  \plc{omp\_allocate()} function is used 
%to allocate space, similar to \plc{malloc}, except that the allocator 
%is specified as the second argument.  
%In Fortran an API allocation function is not available. 
%An \code{allocate} construct is used (with \plc{x} and \plc{y} 
%listed as the variables to be allocated), along
%with an \code{allocator} clause (specifying the \plc{xy\_alloc} as the allocator)
%for the following Fortran \plc{allocate} statement.

In Fortran an \code{allocators} directive is used to specify an allocator
for the following Fortran \plc{allocate} statement.
A variable list in the \scode{allocate} clause may be supplied if the allocator
is to be applied to a subset of variables in the Fortran allocate
statement.
Here, the \plc{xy\_alloc} allocator is specified
in the modifier of the \code{allocator} clause,
and the set of all variables used in the \plc{allocate} statement is specified in the list.

%"for a following Fortran allocation statement" (no using "immediately" here)
% it looks like if you have a list, the allocation statement does not need
% to follow immediately.(?)
% spec5.0 157:19-20 The allocate directive must appear in the same scope as
% the declarations of each of its list items and must follow all such declarations.

When using the \scode{allocators} construct with optional clauses in Fortran code, 
users should be aware of the behavior of a reallocation.

In the following example, the \splc{a} variable is allocated with 64-byte
alignment through the \scode{align} clause of the \scode{allocators} construct.
%The alignment of the newly allocated object, \splc{a}, in the (reallocation)
%assignment \splc{a = b} may not be the same as before.  
The alignment of the newly allocated object, \splc{a}, in the (reallocation)
assignment \splc{a = b} will not be reallocated with the 64-byte alignment, but
with the 32-byte alignment prescribed by the trait of the \splc{my_alloctr} 
allocator. It is best to avoid this problem by constructing and using an
allocator (not the \scode{align} clause) with the required alignment in 
the \scode{allocators} construct.
Note that in the subsequent
deallocation of \splc{a} the deallocation must precede the destruction
of the allocator used in the allocation of \splc{a}.

\ffreeexample[5.2]{allocators}{2}

When creating and using an \scode{allocators} construct within a Fortran procedure
for allocating storage (and subsequently freeing the allocator storage with an 
\scode{omp_destroy_allocator} construct), users should be aware of the necessity
of using an explicit Fortran deallocation instead of relying on auto-deallocation.

In the following example, a user-defined allocator is used in the allocation
of the \splc{c} variable, and then the allocator is destroyed.
Auto-deallocation at the end of the \splc{broken_auto_deallocation} procedure
will fail without the allocator, hence an explicit deallocation should be used 
(before the \scode{omp_destroy_allocator} construct).
Note that an allocator may be specified directly in the \scode{allocate} clause
without using the \scode{allocator} complex modifier, so long as no other modifier 
is specified in the clause.

The \scode{allocate} directive is a convenient way to apply an OpenMP 
allocator to the allocation of declared variables.

This example illustrates the allocation of specific types of storage in a program 
for use in libraries, privatized variables, and with offloading.

Two groups of variables, \{\plc{v1, v2}\} and \{\plc{v3, v4}\}, are used with the \scode{allocate} 
directive, and the \{\plc{v5, v6}\} pair is used with the \scode{allocate} clause. 
Here we explicitly use predefined allocators \scode{omp_high_bw_mem_alloc} and \scode{omp_default_mem_alloc}
with the \scode{allocate} directive in CASE 1. Similar effects are achieved for private variables of a task
by using the \scode{allocate} clause, as shown in CASE 2.  

Note, when the \scode{allocate} directive does not specify an \scode{allocator} clause, an
implementation-defined default, stored in the \splc{def-allocator-var} ICV, is used
(not illustrated here).
Users can set and get the default allocator with the \scode{omp_set_default_allocator}
and \scode{omp_get_default_allocator} API routines.
